# Tic-Tac-Toe

## CMPE 252 Semester Project

ML GUI implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe

There are two files in the Game Code folder. The main_code.ipynb contains all of the
reinforcement learning part of this project. As an added bonus, our team also tried to learn
about pygame to design a GUI, as sen in the GUI_Design file. Since these were done seperately, we are 
still working on combining these two pieces. We have included the GUI_Design file in this repository
in case you would still like to play with it.

To run the code, follow these steps:
  1. Download repository
  2. Open 'Tic-Tac-Toe/Game Code/' folder in terminal
  3. Run the command "jupyter notebook"
  4. Open either main_code.ipynb or GUI_Design.ipynb which are the Reinforcement and GUI implementation respectively
  5. Step through code (shift + enter)
  6. GUI will pop up and allow the game to be played if the GUI_Design.ipynb file is used

Trouble shooting:
  1. Make sure the required dependencies are installed
  2. If a library is missing, type "!pip install (library name)
    a. Example, "!pip install pygame"
